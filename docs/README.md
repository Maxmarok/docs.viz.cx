# What is VIZ blockchain

VIZ is a DAC (Decentralized Autonomous Community), this is to say a blockchain system built with Graphene technology (used in BitShares, Steem, partly in EOS). One of its main distinctive features is the principle of equitable participation in the work of the system (fair consensus, fair economy, fair DAC equity management).
